Linux shell utility

A common complaint of the most-used UNIX shells (Bourne, Korn, C) is that it is difficult to remember (long) file names, and type "long" command names. A "menu" type shell allows a user to "pick" an item (file or command)from a "menu".
This utility will give you some convenient ways to choose your opinions instead of manually input. For example,
Files:
0. a.c
1. a.out
2. a.txt
3. assignment
4. program

Directories: 
0. ..
1. my_dir

Operation:
E Edit
R Run
C Change Directory Q Quit
